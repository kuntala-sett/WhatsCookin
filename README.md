What's Cookin

    What's Cookin is a simple android application aiming to find recipes based on user-provided keyword. 
    
    The keyword provided could be an ingredient, cuisine, diet, etc. Based on this input, a list of recipes are shown
    
    The recipes are being fetched using the spoonacular API. 
    
    
Future Scopes

    Currently the menu items on the landing page are not clickable. Have to implement "quick-search" - search based on item clicked.
    
    Have to optimize the choice of api for fetching recipes - currently only recipe names are being fetched in the api.
